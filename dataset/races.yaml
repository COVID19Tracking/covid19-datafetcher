name: races
index: [STATE]

# Positive, death, negative X Race, Enticity
# Flat list of fields vs Measure (i.e., positives, death, negatives) and race data (i.e., race, ethnicity) with multiple rows per state -- I like it less, even though it'll be nicely tagged I expect it'll be harder to use for our planned use case
fields: [FETCH_TIMESTAMP, TIMESTAMP, DATE,
  POS_WHITE, POS_BLACK, POS_HISPANIC, POS_ASIAN, POS_AIAN, POS_HNPI, POS_OTHER, POS_UNKNOWN,
  DEATH_WHITE, DEATH_BLACK, DEATH_HISPANIC, DEATH_ASIAN, DEATH_AIAN, DEATH_HNPI, DEATH_OTHER, DEATH_UNKNOWN,
  NEG_WHITE, NEG_BLACK, NEG_HISPANIC, NEG_ASIAN, NEG_AIAN, NEG_HNPI, NEG_OTHER, NEG_UNKNOWN]
