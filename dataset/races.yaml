index: [STATE]

# Positive, hospitalization, death, probable death, negative test X race, ethnicity
# Flat list of fields vs Measure (i.e., positives, death, negatives) and race data (i.e., race, ethnicity) with multiple rows per state -- I like it less, even though it'll be nicely tagged I expect it'll be harder to use for our planned use case
