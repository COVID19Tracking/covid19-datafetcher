# Format: State => [queries]
# Query is
# url: The URL to make the request to
# params: url params (in json format, for convenience)
# type: type of query: arcgis, json, csv, etc.
# desc: String description, used to build the links index
# data_path: path in the query result from which to get the data
#
# Only `url` and `type` are mandatory, but I fill `params` with `null` when it's empty, I think that it's nicer this way
